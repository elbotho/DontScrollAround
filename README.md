Don't Scroll Around!
================

It's a rickety jquery plugin for saving scroll-time.
It lets content "click into place" on the top of the page.

I often try to scroll the paragraphs I'm reading to the top of the page, just under the last paragraph.
**Quite annoying**. This plugin tries to ease the nuisance.
